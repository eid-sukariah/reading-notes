To add an image into the page you need to use an `<img>` element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:`<img src="" alt="" title="" height"" width"" />`
`src` r where it can find the image file
`alt` provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see i
`title` to provide additional information about the image
**Where to Place Images in Your Code**
1.  before a paragraph
2.  inside the start of a paragraph
3.  in the middle of a paragraph
Whenever you have many different colors in a picture you should use a **JPEG**.
Use **GIF** or **PNG** format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color.
Images created for the web should be saved at a *resolution of  ppi*. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.
**Vector images** differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images arecommonly created in programs such as *Adobe Illustrator*.
**Animated GIFs** show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.
Creating an image that is partially **transparent** (or "see-through") for the web involves selecting one of two formats:
1. *Transparent GIF* If the transparent part of the image has straight edges and it is 100% transparent (that is, not semi-opaque), you can save the image as a GIF (with the transparency option selected)
2. *PNG* If the transparent part of the image has diagonal or rounded edges or if you want a semiopaque transparency or a dropshadow, then you will need to save it as a PNG.
You can have more than one
- image inside the `<figure>` element as long as they all share the same caption.
- `<figcaption>` The `<figcaption>` element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.

Typeface Terminology:
1. Serif --Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs
2. Sans-Serif -- Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.
3. Monospace-- Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)
