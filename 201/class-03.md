## Lists
1. ordered list `<ol>`
2. unordered list `<ul>`
3. Definition Lists `<dl>` inside it you will see `<dt>`the definition term `<dd>`This is used to contain the definition.

Each item in the list is placed between an opening `<li>` tag and a closing `</li>` tag
**nested list**You can put a second list inside an `<li>` element to create a sublist or nested list.

## Boxes
* Border: Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.
* Margin: Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes. 
* Padding: Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

## array
An array is a special type of variable. It doesnâ€™t just store one value; it stores a list of values. You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of the array). The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma.



## switch statement
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match. switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes.
