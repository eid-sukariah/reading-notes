## text
HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation)
* heading `<h1>` the largest---`<h6>`the smallest
* paragraph `<p>` inline element
* blod `<b>`  `<strong>`importent
* italic `<i>`  `em` Emphasis
* Superscript `<sup>`characters that should be superscript. Subscrip `<sub>`  characters that should be subscript { chemical formulas & power }  E=MC<sup>2</sup>
* Line Breaks`<br>` & Horizontal Rules`<hr>`
* `<blockquote>` for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph  `<q>`s used for shorter quotes.[1]
 
 ## Introducing CSS

A CSS rule contains two parts: a *selector* and a *declaration*.
![CSS rule](https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*naFDyXh9iGtmvNRhhFY-og.png)[3]

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a *property* and a *value*, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

**How Css Rules Cascade**
* LAST RULE
* SPECIFICIT
* IMPORTANT You can add *!important* after any property value[1]

## Basic JavaScript Instructions
The var statement declares a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

DATA TYPES
* numeric: numbers. 
* string: consists of letters and other characters within a pair of quotes.
* boolean: two values: true or false.
### Rules for Naming Variables

1. The first character must be a letter or an underscore (_). You can't use a number as the first character.

2. The rest of the variable name can include any letter, any number, or the underscore. You can't use any other characters, including spaces, symbols, and punctuation marks.

3. As with the rest of JavaScript, variable names are case sensitive. That is, a variable   named Interest_Rate is treated as an entirely different variable than one named interest_rate.

4. There's no limit to the length of the variable name.

5. You can't use one of JavaScript's reserved words as a variable name. All programming languages have a supply of words that are used internally by the language and that can't be used for variable names because doing so would cause confusion (or worse). Note, too, that JavaScript also has many keywords that should be avoided as well.

An **array** is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

## switch statements
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
