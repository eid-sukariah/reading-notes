## ways of specifying colors
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a **color picker**.

## RGB values
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)
 
## hex codes
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80

## color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan

* When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.

## opacity 
CSS3 introduces the *opacity*
property which allows you to
specify the opacity of an element
and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between
0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15%
opacity).
CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive
way to specify colors using *hue*, *saturation*,
and *lightness* values.

# HSL & HSLA

The hsl color property has
been introduced in CSS3 as an
alternative way to specify colors.
The value of the property starts
with the letters hsl, followed
by individual values inside
