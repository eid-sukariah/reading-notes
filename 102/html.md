### HTML LAYOUT
The new HTML elements indicate 
the purpose of different parts of a web page 
and help to describe its structure.
The new elements provide clearer code 
(compared with using multiple <div> elements).

`Wireframes` allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

`Site maps` allow you to plan the structure of a site.
To decide what information should go on each page,
 you can use a technique called card sorting.
