## A web page is a resource?
Kind of. A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs–those things that you type into the browser…

## What is URL?
Those URLs tell the browser that there’s a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.

there’s this concept that people are calling “Web Services” or “APIs”. It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do.

## SuperAgent
SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js!
