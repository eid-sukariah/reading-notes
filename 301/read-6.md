## Node.js Used For
simply it can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking… & 4sure ‘running JavaScript on the server!’

The **V8 engine** is the open-source JavaScript engine that *runs* in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

> If you open the package.json file, you’ll see lodash listed under the dependencies field. By specifying your project’s dependencies in this way, you allow any developer anywhere to clone your project and use npm to install whatever packages it needs to run.

## What Kind of Apps Is Node.js Suited To?
Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration — for example, chat sites, or apps such as CodeShare, where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else. It’s also a good fit for building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven (such as those needing to perform operations on a database), or for sites involving data streaming, as Node makes it possible to process files while they’re still being uploaded.

And it doesn’t stop at the server. There are many other exciting and varied uses of Node.js! For example it can be used as a scripting language to automate repetitive or error prone tasks on your PC. It can also be used to write your own command line tool, such as this Yeoman-Style generator to scaffold out new projects. Node.js can also can be used to build cross-platform desktop apps and even to create your own robots. What’s not to love?? ^-^
