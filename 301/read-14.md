**Database Normalization**
Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.

**Reasons for Database Normalization**
There are three main reasons to normalize a database. The first is to minimize duplicate data, the second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues, and the third is to simplify queries.

**Insert Anomaly**
There are facts we cannot record until we know information for the entire row. In our example we cannot record a new sales office until we also know the sales person. Why? Because in order to create the record, we need provide a primary key. In our case this is the EmployeeID.

**Update Anomaly**
In this case we have the same information in several rows. For instance if the office number changes, then there are multiple updates that need to be made. If we donâ€™t update all rows, then inconsistencies appear.

Deletion Anomaly Deletion of a row causes removal of more than one set of facts. For instance, if John Hunt retires, then deleting that row cause us to lose information about the New York office.
