## Links
Links are created using the `<a>` element. Users can click on anything between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
* The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
* You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
* You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

## Layout
Key Concepts in Positioning Elements:
* Block-level elements start on a new line Examples include:
`<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`
* Inline elements flow in between surrounding text Examples include: `<img> <b> <i>`

## FUNCTION
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

## Pair Programming

## How does pair programming work?
pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
the Driver manages the text editor,switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
