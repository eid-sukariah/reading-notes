## Links
Links are created using the `<a>` element. Users can click on anything between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
* The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
* You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
* You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

## Layout
Key Concepts in Positioning Elements:
* Block-level elements start on a new line Examples include:
`<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`
* Inline elements flow in between surrounding text Examples include: `<img> <b> <i>`

## FUNCTION
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
