## what loop in jst

One of the most common tasks you have to deal with in JSP is outputting a set of data by using the Java for and while loop. By doing so, you create a very unreadability JSP page with opening and closing curly brace. In addition, if something an error occurred, it is difficult to detect the code that causes the problem.

Fortunately, JSTL provides you with two useful actions for looping and iteration: for general data and for a string of tokens.
