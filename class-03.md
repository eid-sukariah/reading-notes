Each item in the list is placed between an opening `<li>` tag and a closing `</li>` tag
**nested list**You can put a second list inside an `<li>` element to create a sublist or nested list.

## Boxes
* Border: Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.
* Margin: Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes. 
* Padding: Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.
